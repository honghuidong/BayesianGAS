This repository contains the code and (most of) the data necessary to reproduce the results and analysis presented in my master thesis Bayesian Inference for Generalized Autoregressive Score Models. For the analysis of Dynamic Pooled Marked Point Process models a nonpublic dataset was used. Therefore, I included an equivalent analysis based on simulated data.
